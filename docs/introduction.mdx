## Overview

The SDK provides a comprehensive interface to interact with WooCommerce's Store API and Admin REST API endpoints. It handles authentication, session management, cart tokens, nonces, and provides strongly-typed responses for all API operations.

## Key Features

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strongly-typed request parameters and responses powered by Zod schemas
- **Store API Support**: Complete coverage of WooCommerce Store API endpoints.
- **Admin REST API Support**: Full access to WooCommerce REST API v3 for administrative operations
- **Authentication**: Built-in support for JWT authentication with automatic token refresh
- **Session Management**: Automatic handling of nonces and cart tokens via Axios interceptors
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Custom EventBus for reactive state management
- **Request Lifecycle Hooks**: Callbacks for request, response, error, and loading states
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable automatic retry for failed requests
- **Storage Flexibility**: Pluggable storage providers (localStorage, sessionStorage, memory)

## Architecture

Typewoo SDK is organized into three main service layers:

### Store API (`Typewoo.store`)

The Store API provides public-facing endpoints optimized for storefront use:

- **Cart**: Full cart management (add, update, remove items, apply coupons)
- **Checkout**: Process orders and payments
- **Orders**: Retrieve order details for pay-for-order flows
- **Products**: Browse and search products

### Auth API (`Typewoo.auth`)

The Auth API handles user authentication:

- **Token Management**: Obtain and refresh JWT tokens
- **Session Validation**: Validate token status
- **Auto-Login**: Generate one-time tokens for seamless authentication

### Admin API (`Typewoo.admin`)

The Admin API provides access to WooCommerce REST API v3 endpoints:

- **Products**: Full CRUD operations on products and variations
- **Orders**: Order management and processing
- **Customers**: Customer data management
- **Settings**: Store configuration
- **Reports**: Sales and analytics data

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or higher
- WooCommerce 8.0 or higher with Store API enabled
- Typewoo WordPress plugin (for authentication features)
